**Install Plugin called Pipeline**

**Pipeline will allow you to create an orchestrated Pipeline for Jenkins projects**

**You can also create a jenkinsfile, which is basically a script which tells jenkins in which order program needs to be built**

**You can put jenkins file in the same github repo as the other scripts, and jenkins will figure out how it gets executed**
